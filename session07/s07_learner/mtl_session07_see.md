## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the base case of no new decisions in your team.
2. Test out your thinking about what is likely to cause oscillation in team trends.
3. Apply systems thinking to develop a hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Running a Base Case

1. Login to your team world at mtl.how/sim.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/sim_ui_1.gif)

2. You can *Join Current Session* or *Start a New Session* in any module.

2.	Orient yourself to the main page: Team Name; selected module; selected data file.  All settings in the Experiments tile are at Base Case or default values.

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

3.	Open the Expanded Outputs section and enter text in the boxes to reflect your question and hypothesis about a base case run â€“ one where no changes are made and you run the simulation out to its 2-year end just using the data pulled in from your team data file.

4.	Run; then Save (without resetting) the run with the name Base Case.

5.	Review the Current Run Experiment Values in the Control Panel: shows Base Case or default values.

6.	Orient yourself to the charts in the Results Dashboard (axes, units, legend, drop-down menu options).

7.	What do you notice about the results? Do they match your hypothesis? Compare the values you see in the charts with the Team Data Table numbers.

8.	Record your Findings in the Text section.

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  

9.	Decide what you want to look into next. Record your Decisions in the Text section. Save and Reset when ready.
