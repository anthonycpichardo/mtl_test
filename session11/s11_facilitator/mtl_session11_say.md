# Today we're modeling to learn how to make _future_ team decisions.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

### As you can see in the Done/Do table in the Learner See Guide:

## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.

### Let's get started:

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Pulling together team learnings, decisions, and vision

1. Throughout *Modeling to Learn*, we've made lots of team decisions. Let's review them and see what they mean for future decisions.

2. In session 1, we created a shared vision for *Modeling to Learn*. We've tied our experiments and decisions throughout *MTL* to that vision.  
   
3. In sessions 2 and 3 we explored team data and trends using the *MTL* data UI. We learned how to find an individual patient, how to visualize trends over time for our own care or the teams's as a whole. And we built our team data file for use in the sim.

4. In session 4 we completed the *MTL* Menu. Looking at the results, we identified our team need and which of the 5 *MTL* modules would be best for exploring it over the next 6 sessions.

5. In sessions 5 through 10 we used the _MTL_ sim UI to better understand the **causal system story** of our team's need over time. Let's look at our session 10 Question/Hypothesis/Findings/Decision Text, where we can review the questions and hypotheses of the **practice decisions** that we simulated to find the new decisions that would best meet the needs of the majority of Veterans we serve.
    
6. As recorded in our findings and decisions, let's discuss what our findings and decisions mean for the team going forward. _As we discuss new individual and team practice decisions keep in mind the systems thinking rationale for **why** a practice decision would lead to desired outcomes over time._ As we discuss these questions consider **Complexity,** **Feedback,** and **System Behavior** over **Time.**
   + What insights we will keep in mind as we make future team decisions?
   + What new decisions, approaches, or targets do we want to adopt in our team?  
   + Let's think about the key insights we've gotten about decisions that are within our control.
   + What concrete actions will we take?
   + How do those decisions align with our team's vision and needs?  
   + What data will we watch to see how we're doing?  

### That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to make _future team decisions_. Next is our Done/Do review.

### DO demo

1. After we complete *Modeling to Learn* next time, you can still access ALL the *MTL* resources we've used.

2. You can log in to the sim UI and review all the experiments we saved in the Team and Individual worlds. 

3. You can run new experiments in the same module - or in any of the other 5 _MTL_ modules.

4. You can log in to the data UI and look at all sorts of team and individual trends.

5. And of course, there are many materials and links at mtl.how.

6. For next time, as you have time, look back at those resources to refresh your memory, and be thinking about how they might be useful to you after *MTL*.

## Until then, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!
