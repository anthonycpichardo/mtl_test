## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe the decisions you experimented with and how they are intertwined with other decisions and clinic outcomes over time.
2.	Test your understanding of the causal system story by describing what’s happening when it produces a system behavior over time.
3.	Apply your thinking to anticipate the short and long term trends in your team's care quality under different decision scenarios.

### Let's get started:

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)


**We've been _Modeling to Learn_ how to improve our use of systems thinking when making care decisions in our team.**

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | -- 
Complex | **Forest   not trees.**    Relationships among two or more units (patients, weeks) variables (stocks: patients waiting to start, flows: improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary   care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line.**    Not simple cause and effect. The end of   the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing)   or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie   not snapshot.**    Trends over time.    Systems cause their own behavior   through feedback.
Time | **Short   and   long term.**      Better understanding of change over   time   (e.g., worse before better, better   before worse).

**We'll work to apply these skills as we review our combined experiment 3 today.**

_If you did not reset the Team World at the end of Session 9:_

1. Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session, which should be at the end of the **Experiment 2.** 

- The advantage of starting **session 10** at the end of the Experiment 2 run in the Team World, is that you can compare the **system behaviors** of Experiment 2 (the current run) against both the Base Case (alternative 1) and Experiment 1 (alternative 2). 

- You can also **refine the Experiment 2 text** with the team to further build applied systems thinking skills. 

- Expand the **Outputs and Text Section** and select the Base Case and Experiment 1 compare to the Experiment 2 results.

_If you reset the Team World at the end of Session 9:_

1. Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session.

- From the **Experiment Section,** pull up experiment 2 and click the red "Go" button.  

- Check the box **Include the text from experiment 2 and click "Go."** again.  

- Note that the **Experiment Sliders automatically adjust** to the settings selected for experiment 2. 

- Hit **Run** to re-run Experiment 2, for comparison against the Base Case and Experiment 1.

2. In the **Results Dashboard** review how the causal feedback explains why the simulated **team practice decisions** produce the specific **variables and values** produced in the system behaviors over time.

3. Minimize **Outputs and Text** and move the text to the **Right** to reveal the causal system diagram.  

4. **Refine/edit Experiment 2 text** to capture the causal explanations for the differences between the Base Case, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 entered for Hypothesis, Findings and Decisions.  

5. **Right click** or use **Control + C** to **copy the Decisions Text,** and then click **Save and Reset** to save the refined text edits for Experiment 2.

6. Once reset, **Right click** or use **Control + V** to **Paste the Decision Text** in the **Question Box** for Experiment 3. Refine the text as necessary to reflect today's learning goal to combine the team decisions reflected in Experiment 1 and 2. 

7. **Use then causal system story in the model diagram to craft a **Dynamic Hypothesis** that explains the expected system behaviors that will be produced under the combined decisions reflected in Experiment 3. 

8. Minimize the **Outputs and Text** Section and move the text to the **Left** to reveal the **Experiment Section** and adjust sliders to reflect the combined Experiment 3.

9. Hit the green **Run** button to run Experiment 3.

10. In the **Results Dashboard** review how the causal feedback explains why the **combined team practice decisions** produce the **relative differences in specific variables and values** produced in the system behaviors over time.

11. **Enter Findings text** that causally explains the differences between the Base Case, Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3. 

- Model systems thinking for the team, by highlighting the C.F.B.T. systems thinking concepts that are included in the q/h/f/d text boxes.

- Note the **dominant causal feedback that produces the system behaviors,** and note the **highest leverage (high yield) decisions** that are most **clinically feasible** for the team to implement in their care. 

10. **Enter Decisions Text** to reflect **new practice decisions the team would like to consider next** and then click **Save** to save the text edits for Experiment 3.


**Module Specific Examples for Experiment 3**  

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

  Let's start with editing our **Our Question** using the text from our session 09 Decision Text box:
  
   + **CC**: What happens when we experiment with increasing our overall Appointment Supply in Care Coordination and increasing our targeted Return Visit Interval for existing patients?
     
   + **MM**: TEXT NEEDS TO BE INSERTED: Changes to the allocation of x-waiver provider appointments for OUD and RVI for the patient diagnositic cohorts, resulted in..... Now we want to explore ...  
     
   + **PSY**: What is the combined effect of graduating 75% of all completers AND increasing Initiators who Complete to 75% on the number of patients who receive an EB dose of PSY?  
     
   + **AGG**:  For our next experiment, what would happen if we allowed an increase in sensitivity to work pressure, such that the team would be willing to work more hours than usual to make up backlogs of patients waiting to start services.
     
   + **SP**: What happens to our high-risk patient populations if we implemented both measurement based care and stepped care?  


[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*  

  + Research into experiential learning with simulation has shown that it is more impactful if the group “stakes a claim” before seeing the results of a possible future scenario.  
  
  + Ask, “What do you think the effects will be of these changes?  How much better will things get?”  Push the team to be as specific as possible, both with their change and the result.  
  
  + Type these variables and predictions into the “Our Hypothesis” box.  
    
   + **CC**: We hypothesize that the combined effect of pushing RVI out by 2 weeks and adding CC appointments will reduce our Missed Appointment % because there are fewer patient appts in the books.

   + **MM**: INSERT CORRECTED TEXT - We hypothesize that changing OUD x waiver appointment slots, RVI for specific patient diagnostic segments, and .... will...  
   
   + **PSY**: We hypothesize that the combined effects of increasing the number of Initiators who Complete from the base case rate of 37% to 75% with an increase in helping the number of Completers to graduate will have a robust effect on the number of patients who complete and graduate compared to the base case. We expect to see that more than 99 patients are Completers who have finished a full course of therapy.  
   
   + **AGG**: Given that the team will lose two staff, we agree that we are willing to work additional time, if need be. Our rebalancing of services and our commitment to reduce the RVI for PSY and EB PSY to between 1 and 2 weeks, combined with a willingness to provide a moderate about of additional over time hours will resolve any backlogs of patients waiting to start services.
   
   + **SP**: When we increased care quality and symptom detection (via measurement-based care), we saw patient outcomes improve dramatically, but at the cost of higher wait times for our patients stepping down to Primary Care. When we streamlined transitions between settings (via implementing stepped care), we saw higher start rates in both settings, but again saw higher wait times for patients stepping down from our team to Primary Care and a higher ratio of high to low symptom patients in our team. Combining these experiments should lead to even more benefits to our patients: better outcomes, fewer patients with high risk flags, higher start rates. However, we believe we will also see even higher wait times for the patients that we recommend step down to Primary Care.  
   

**Run Experiment 3**  

  + Restate the new care decisions that are being simulated, and move the Text box with the Question and Hypothesis text to the left, in order to reveal the experiment sliders.  
  
  + Move each slider named in the question to its desired value, and click  the green “Run” icon.  Name this run according to the variables you adjusted.  
  
  + To name the run, click on the down arrow next to Variable, choose the variable name you changed, for example, Appointment Supply or Return Visit Interval. Click *Add*. This will insert an abbreviation of that variable into the experiment name. Next, click on the down arrow next to Number, choose the number that represents the new value you used in your experiment.  Finally, click *Save* (not Save & Reset, just Save). The date will automatically be added to the name of the saved experiment.  
  

**Compare System Behaviors**  

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*  

   + **CC**: Our True Missed Appointment rate is similar that achieved with just increasing RVI.
   
   + **MM**: TEXT NEEDS TO BE INSERTED
    
   + **PSY**: We found that there was an increase in the number of patients being served (from N=371 BC and N=460 EXP1) to N=480! We also found that we have an increase in Initiators, as expected (n=373) and in Completers, as expected (n=280). We saw a robust number of patients over the BC (n=4) in persons who completed and graduated (n=70). This was decreased from n=90, when we only changed the % of completers who graduated, but not Initiators. However, with the combined decisions, we enjoyed a higher starting rate and a higher initiation rate after one year, and the we saw an improved graduation rate over the BC from the start of the run.

   + **AGG**: Our hypothesis is supported! We see similar patterns as before, but the willingness to work a bit more over time improves all metrics, from patient start times to patient rescheduing, to actual hours available for service!
   
   + **SP**: [OPEN EXPANDED OUTPUTS] In our team, we see a drop in the ratio of high to low symptom patients, where the increased inflow of high-symptom patients created by implementing stepped care is almost completely counter-acted by the increase in quality from implementing Measurement-Based Care (from a ratio of 0.6 high-symptom to 1 low-symptom patient to a ratio of only to 0.25 to 1 ).  The number of patients with a high risk flag drops to its lowest ever, as does patients waiting to start, which we are able to reduce by 2/3rds (from almost 90 patients waiting to 27).  Wait time to step up to Specialty mental health also drops by 2/3rds (from 28 weeks to less than 10 weeks).  In almost all measures, the gains in quality and time to detect from implementing Measurement-Based Care almost completely counter-act the increased demand to our team generated by implementing Stepped Care.  
Furthermore, if we look back at "Patient Load," then we see that the total number of patients in GMH is slightly, but significantly, lower than the historical average, reducing stress and further increasing care quality over the gains seen by implemeting Measurement-Based Care alone, pushing our team further in a virtuous cycle of quality improvement.
However, as expected, not all patients benefit from these changes.  Patients stepping down from our team to Primary Care now have their highest wait time across all our experiments - 60 weeks!  Simultaneously increasing quality in GMH and reducing the delays on stepping patients down to Primary Care puts incredible pressure on Primary Care to see more mental health patients.  [CHANGE PATIENT LOAD TO "GMH to PC/PCMHI Recommend Step Down Rate"] Even as our team reacts to the increasing wait time, and the "Recommend Step Down to PC Rate" drops from a high of recommending 11 patients per week step down to only 6.2, this is always more patients per week that Primary Care can start.  
In summary, increasing quality in GMH and reducing the delays on stepping patients down to PC puts additional pressure on PC to see more MH patients – pressure that they can’t currently accommodate.  All predictions confirmed!

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?* 

   + **CC**: We're going to increase our RVI and decrease new patient wait time to integrate more new patients into CC without negatively impacting our Team's Missed Appointment %. 
   
   + **MM**: TEXT NEEDS TO BE INSERTED
   
   + **PSY**: We think that working to support a 75% rate of Initiators who complete 8 sessions of PSY in 3 months combined with efforts to support a 75% graduation rate of patients who complete 8 sessions of PSY is a clinically valuable and viable strategy. It increases supply of appts for new patients while increasing the number of patients who get an evidence-based dose of PSY.

   + **AGG**: We will agree to work a moderate amount of overtime, but also to rebalance our service mix in favor of conducting more EBPSY, while not changing the proportion of any services so much that we are not meeting overall demand for CC, MM, ADJ or GROUP.
   
   + **SP**: For either of these improvement efforts to be truly successful, Primary Care needs to expand their capacity to see mental health patients. We will take these findings to our chief, to show how our two settings are connected, and that our well-intended actions to improve care or remove barriers between our settings could have a detrimental effect on mental health access in Primary Care. We will propose a series of trainings to PC staff to increase their comfort taking on mental health patients, and thus increase their capacity. We will conduct more experiments to try to estimate the size of the capacity increase necessary to prevent an increase in wait time.

**Add the Decisions Text to Reflect New Decisions that could be incorporated in Clinical Practice**  

- [Facilitator should model for the team, and highlight the C.F.B.T. systems thinking concepts that are included in the q/h/f/d text boxes.
- Note the dominant causal feedback that produces the system behaviors, and note the highest leverage (high yield) decisions that are most clinically feasible for the team to implement in their care. 

## That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to use systems thinking. Next is our Done/Do review.

Today we logged in to the sim UI to run experiment 3 and explored the system behaviors using systems thinking skills. Before next time, review and compare the base case with experiments 1, 2 and 3 and consider new team care decisions that you can apply in practice.
